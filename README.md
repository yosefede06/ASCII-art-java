Software that converts image files to ASCII art

Solution Overview:

The main idea is to convert an image file into ASCII art. This involves reading the image file, processing the image data and converting each pixel into an ASCII character based on its color intensity. The resulting ASCII image can be either printed to the console or saved as an HTML file.

Technical Details:

Image Representation: To represent an image, we need to read the image file and store its data in a 2-dimensional array. Each cell in the array represents a pixel in the image and holds the color information in the form of three basic colors - Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). These colors are determined by the intensity of illumination of the respective color, where the intensity scale is from 0-255. The image data can be represented as a Color object, with fields for R, G, and B.

ASCII Art Conversion: To convert the image into ASCII art, we need to map the color intensity of each pixel to an ASCII character. This can be done by dividing the intensity into a certain number of levels and assigning an ASCII character to each level. For example, a character with higher intensity can be mapped to a full block character (â–ˆ), while a character with lower intensity can be mapped to a less dense character (.).

User Interface: A user interface can be built to provide an option for the user to select the image file and choose the desired output format. The output can either be printed to the console or saved as an HTML file, which will allow for the ASCII art to be viewed in a browser.
